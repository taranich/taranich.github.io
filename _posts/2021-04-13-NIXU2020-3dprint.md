## The Challenge
After reading [challenge description](https://thenixuchallenge.com/c/3dprint) seems there should not be difficulties
in solving this one, yeah?

[![Challenge Description](/images/write-ups/NIXU2020/3dprint/challenge.png)](/images/write-ups/NIXU2020/3dprint/challenge.png)

It looks like flag was printed in hex and we should have a video of the process. Easy-peasy! Let's download that video and watch it...

## The Solution
Here we go...

*Whoops!*

... Oh, no! What a bad luck :(

3D Printer starts to print something what looks like a text, suddenly camera turns and we cannot see anymore printing area.
Just a lone standing flower. We have managed to spot only following printed text:
> 3d_
So, what options do we have? It might be that video is just a false path and actual flag is steganographically encoded into the file.
Though, if we carefully read challenge description once more we may notice tag *dsp*  which stands to "Digital Signal Processing".

What if we can use audio track to figure out printed text? If we carefully watch video again we may spot that stepper motors tone is not
constant and its variation correlates to the extruder movement. A human with a sense of perfect pitch might mentally visualize
extruder movement and see what is actually printed. Unfortunatelly I don't have that sense. So, let's extract 
[audio track](/files/write-ups/NIXU2020/3dprint/print.wav) from video and build spectrogram from it:

[![Spectrogram](/images/write-ups/NIXU2020/3dprint/spectrogram.png)](/images/write-ups/NIXU2020/3dprint/spectrogram.png)

Watching side by side video and spectrogram we can spot that straight vertical and horizontal movements of extruder are clearly
reflected on spectrogram on different frequencies. Luckily for us up / down and left / right movements also produce different
tones and this mean that we can completely restore what has been printed!

Let's take a look more closely on first several seconds from spectrogram:

Printer initialization and initial extruder pozitioning produce tones on multiple frequenies. After it we may spot on video direct
vertical / horizontal movements of extruder and corresponding tones are visible on spectrogram. Then short period of extruder repositioning
is following. Next we see again direct movements related to printing 2nd character. Again extruder repositioning, etc.
